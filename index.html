        <h1>Git Commit</h1>

        <h3>The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.</h3>
        <p>Using the "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository. Exchanging commits has to be performed manually and explicitly (with the "git fetch", "git pull", and "git push" commands).

            Important Options</p>
            <p>The -a flag is used in git to add all the files to your commit and then you'll have to run another command where you write your commit message.
                The m flag is used for connecting a commit message to your commit for example `git commit -m "your message".</p>
